# Custom Menus for Self Hosted netboot.xyz

This directory contains custom iPXE files that are rendered
during menu generation and available from the main menu via
the custom menu option.

When these options are set:

```
custom_generate_menus: true
custom_templates_dir: "{{ netbootxyz_conf_dir }}/custom"
```

the menu will add an option for custom menus and attempt to load into
custom/custom.ipxe.  From there custom options can be built and
maintained seperately from the netboot.xyz source tree so that both
menus can be updated independently.

A sample menu is provided to demonstrate how to configure and set up
a menu.  You can copy the custom directory from the repo:

```
cp etc/netbootxyz/custom /etc/netbootxyz/custom
```
