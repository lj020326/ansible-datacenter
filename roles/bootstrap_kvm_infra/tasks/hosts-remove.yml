# These tasks needs to update the same file
# Because multiple tasks are run in parallel, data can go missing
# We need to either run this in serial, or
# Run this once only, on one host with a lookup for all other hosts
# Because serial is messy and requires custom plays, I'm doing the latter
# Thus, while this should be run against the kvmhost host, the task out show as being against one of your guests
