## YAML based inventory, see:

#
## Define the KVM host, it is referenced in the play by the "kvmhost" group
## This example is localhost, but you can set whatever vars you need to here
## The KVM host is where the networks are defined, under either "absent" or "present"
## This allows us to clean up and remove networks you no-longer need
kvmhost:
  hosts:
    # Put your KVM host connection and settings here
    localhost:
      ansible_connection: local
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
      virt_infra_vbmc: true
  vars:
    # Networks are a list, you can add more than one
    # You can create and remove NAT networks on kvmhost (creating bridges not supported)
    # The 'default' network is the standard one shipped with libvirt
    # By default we don't remove any networks (empty absent list)
