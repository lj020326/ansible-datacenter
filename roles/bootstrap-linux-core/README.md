This role will bootstrap a CentOS 7 node.

It consists of two steps, the first step will copy an ssh key and disable root password login, the second step will configure the system.

Requirements
------------

A CentOS instance with root ssh access with password, an account with sudo priviledges will be created and the root user login disabled.

The role will set the hostname of the host using a DNS query, for this it is required that the inventory hostname resolves to a single ipv4 address.
