# Master playbook for setting up KVM guests on a KVM host using an inventory
# Requires a KVM host and qemu-img, virsh, virt-customize and virt-sysprep.
#
# Limit your inventory to the group of VMs you want to set up, like this:
# ansible-playbook \
# --ask-become-pass \
# --limit kvmhost,guests \
# --inventory ./inventory/hosts.yml \
# ./virt-infra.yml
#
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  roles:
    - ansible-role-virt-infra

# Now you can use the inventory to do anything else you want...
