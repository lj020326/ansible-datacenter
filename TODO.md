            (3) the cert manager node (called the keyring node in our playbooks)                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
            There are issues when the tasks running on the provisioned node delegate tasks to the cert manager                                                                                                                                                                
            The issues usually are ssh/sudo related to the cert manager                                                                                                                                                                                                       
            We want to reduce/eliminate the dependency on ansible to automate the cert manager                                                                                                                                                                                
            We prefer to use/leverage an API that ansible can then call to get the cacert for the node.

            At first glance this appears to interact with other external 3rd party agents to create/sign the cert                                                                                                                                                             
            Need to research further if this server can also create internally ca signed certs.                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
            Results of search to date seems to indicate that this only operates/serves the kubernetes ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                              
            I cannot find any useful examples showing how to use this for baremetal cert create/signing use cases.
