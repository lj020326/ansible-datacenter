module: win_authorized_key
short_description: Adds or removes an SSH authorized key
description:
  - Ansible module to add or to remove SSH authorized keys for particular user accounts on Windows-based systems.
requirements:
  - Win32 OpenSSH
options:
  user:
    description:
      - The username on the remote host whose authorized_keys file will be modified
    required: true
    type: str
  key:
    description:
      - The SSH public key(s), as a string or (since 1.9) url U(https://github.com/username.keys)
    required: true
    type: str
  path:
    description:
      - Alternate path to the authorized_keys file
    default: "(homedir)+/.ssh/authorized_keys"
    type: str
  manage_dir:
    description:
      - Whether this module should manage the directory of the authorized key file.
      - If set, the module will create the directory, as well as set the owner and permissions
        of an existing directory.
      - Be sure to set I(manage_dir)=C(no) if you are using an alternate directory for
        authorized_keys, as set with C(path), since you could lock yourself out of
        SSH access. See the example below.
    type: bool
    default: 'yes'
  state:
    description:
      - Whether the given key (with the given key_options) should or should not be in the file
    choices: [ "present", "absent" ]
    default: "present"
    type: str
  key_options:
    description:
      - A string of ssh key options to be prepended to the key in the authorized_keys file
    type: str
  exclusive:
    description:
      - Whether to remove all other non-specified keys from the authorized_keys file. Multiple keys
        can be specified in a single I(key) string value by separating them by newlines.
      - This option is not loop aware, so if you use C(with_) , it will be exclusive per iteration
        of the loop, if you want multiple keys in the file you need to pass them all to C(key) in a
        single batch as mentioned above.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
  validate_certs:
    description:
      - This only applies if using a https url as the source of the keys.
      - If set to C(no), the SSL certificates will not be validated.
      - This should only set to C(no) used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates as it avoids verifying the source site.
    type: bool
    default: yes
  comment:
    description:
      - Change the comment on the public key. Rewriting the comment is useful in cases such as fetching it from GitHub or GitLab.
      - If no comment is specified, the existing comment will be kept.
    type: str
  follow:
    description:
      - Follow path symlink instead of replacing it
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
