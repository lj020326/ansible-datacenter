# Open Source versus Certification Path Knowledge Sharing Models

There are many certification paths in the technology realm.  

If I had a certificate for every piece of technology, including both hardware (hw) and software (sw), that I have used in my infrastructures, I would have to required another many years to accomplish the end-state.

## The build, prove, run and "own it" Model... 

I believe this topic will be getting more and more traction over time as some technology companies revert to the paywall/certification model of disseminating product knowledge. 

This model was employed by many large technology firms in the 90's and early 2000's (e.g., cisco, ibm, oracle, etc) until the model was disrupted by the open source model used by many upstart firms in the 2010 era (RH, google, netflix, atlassian, airbnb, ...).  
 
The premise is that there have been too few realized returns on obtaining certifications versus the benefits of actually building products/infrastructure and all that comes with the end-goal based approach versus the academic/training based "certificate" based approach.

There are more and more cases where engineers wear multiple hats including but not limited to the developer hat, the tester hat, the implementor hat as well as the product designer hat.  

They have a driven goal to getting working PoCs to a product state and avoid the hazards of becoming overly, too-focused/specialized on any of the supporting tech to get to the goal.  

When the product takes off and the need exists for the advanced specialist, then go to the source provider rather than the VA vendor. 

The fundamental premise is that by open sourcing, knowledge sharing/transfer can occur far more rapidly and in a way that the HW/SW gets far more usage and returns by enabling a much wider usage aided with sharing of experiences in basic, advanced, and edge use cases and then subsequent adoption into enterprise toolchains by doing so. 
 
In general, I much rather have someone who actually built their own product on my team than a cert specialist that has spent all their time in a niche to get to a level X cert but cannot actually build anything and has nothing to show for the effort other than a piece of paper with little return for the effort. 

I often like when the engineer has a "shark tank" mentality - meaning they want to get to something that is worth showing off to a set of investors.  

The necessary skills will invariably take shape but not in a "vendor-centric-serving" way/method/approach, but in a product driven format.
