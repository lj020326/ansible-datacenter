## LAB: Implement First Playbook

This scenario shows:
- how to create ansible playbooks
- how to run "apt install" command in the playbook
- how to run "update" command in the playbook
- how to run "apt remove" command in the playbook
- how to run command according to distribution (when)

### Prerequisite

- You should have a look following lab, nodes that are created in that LAB, are using in ansible commands
  - [LAB: Multipass-SSH Configuration (Create Ansible Test Environment)](./Multipass-SSH-Configuration.md)

### Steps

- Create playbook to install apache2 app on nodes

#### "Apt Install" command in the playbook

``` 
nano install_apache.yml
# copy followings:
---

- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

  - name: install apache2 package
    apt:
      name: apache2
```

![image](./img/201100926-480de972-078e-4541-9f06-30b625c71585.png)

- Run playbook

``` 
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass install_apache.yml
``` 

- Under Task "install apache2 package", status are changed, this means installing apache2 packet on the nodes successfully

![image](./img/201101843-efc4262d-5506-404e-b505-0d91131154df.png)

- If you run again that command, it is seen that "ok" under the Task "install apache2 package", it means that there is no change

![image](./img/201102379-69fe5e2b-7793-421d-add0-25d88b19b969.png)

- When you enter the one of the nodes' IP on the browser, you can see that the apache2 server is installed on it

![image](./img/201103096-a62b7d08-1208-485f-8bd4-de5b5c7b1e06.png)

- If you enter "never-existed-tect-package" as apt name, you can see that it cannot install on the nodes, because it does not exist.

#### "Update" command in the playbook

- Add "apt update" and install other packages

``` 
---

- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

  - name: update repository index
    apt:
      update_cache: yes

  - name: install apache2 package
    apt:
      name: apache2

  - name: add php support for apache
    apt:
      name: libapache2-mod-php
``` 

![image](./img/201105158-4b3e598b-0726-444f-8844-ee99fc8f8d82.png)

``` 
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass install_apache.yml
``` 

![image](./img/201105473-2697a57a-4334-484f-97d9-501452007259.png)

- Add "state: latest" to install latest version of the app

``` 
---

- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

  - name: update repository index
    apt:
      update_cache: yes

  - name: install apache2 package
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: latest

  - name: add php support for apache
    apt:
      name: libapache2-mod-php
      state: latest
```

![image](./img/201106278-537221bf-878a-4ee3-b211-83e9e52e252f.png)

#### "Apt remove" command in the playbook

- Create "remove_apache.yml" to uninstall apps.
- Use "state:absent" to uninstall.

``` 
---

- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

  - name: remove apache2 package
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: absent

  - name: add php support for apache
    apt:
      name: libapache2-mod-php
      state: absent
```

![image](./img/201107052-4e2c2d50-d7e7-44dd-8352-bd91f7e7be6b.png)

``` 
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass remove_apache.yml
``` 

![image](./img/201107516-ff2b2337-a01c-401d-af0a-177ac38c58c7.png)

- When browsing IP to see whether apache2 works or not, it is seen that apache2 server was uninstalled.

#### Command According to the Distribution ("when")

- Add 'when: ansible-distribution == "Ubuntu"' into the install_apache.yaml file
- With 'when', it is possible to install command on specific distro (e.g. Ubuntu, Centos)

``` 
---

- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

  - name: update repository index
    apt:
      update_cache: yes
    when: ansible_distribution in ["Debian", "Ubuntu"]

  - name: install apache2 package
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: latest
    when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"

  - name: add php support for apache
    apt:
      name: libapache2-mod-php
      state: latest
    when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"
```
- To get more information about the specific node. 

```
ansible all -m gather_facts --limit 172.21.79.85 | grep ansible_distribution
```

![image](./img/201655623-98733d68-3624-48a1-8589-d6ec62bbf7aa.png)

- It is possible to use 'when' commands with other details (e.g. "ansible_distribution_version": "22.04")

- Adding new tasks for 'CentOS' distribution

```
---

- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

  - name: update repository index
    apt:
      update_cache: yes
    when: ansible_distribution in ["Debian", "Ubuntu"]

  - name: install apache2 package
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: latest
    when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"

  - name: add php support for apache
    apt:
      name: libapache2-mod-php
      state: latest
    when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"

  - name: update repository index
    dnf:
      update_cache: yes
    when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"

  - name: install apache2 package
    dnf:
      name: httpd
      state: latest
    when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"

  - name: add php support for apache
    dnf:
      name: php
      state: latest
    when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
```
Run: 
``` 
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass install_apache.yml
``` 
- Tasks that are defined for 'CentOS' are skipped
